## Description
Bills… One of the biggest challenges of adulting! Every month we deal with an endless stream of bills and payments each due for various dates within the month. If we don’t keep track of these consistently, we risk running out of our budget before the next paycheck comes or we might forget to pay them on time resulting in overdue charges. But worry no more! Bill$ is here to make your life easier, so you can enjoy the fun parts of being an adult. With the user friendly calendar interface of Bill$, you can save your upcoming payments with due dates, see a list of all the payments you need to make through the month, see payments before their due date to avoid late fees, and overall have more visibility into your finances to keep better track of your budget.
